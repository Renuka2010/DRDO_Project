MISRA-C
MISRA-C (Motor Industry Software Reliability Association – C) is a coding standard for the C language used to write safe, reliable, and predictable embedded software.
HISTORY
•	Draft: 1997
•	First edition: 1998 (rules, required/advisory)
•	Second edition: 2004 (rules, required/advisory)
•	Third edition: 2012 (directives; rules, Decidable/Undecidable)
•	MISRA compliance: 2016, updated 2020
•	MISRA C:2023 (MISRA C Third edition, Second revision)
Why MISRA-C is used
•	Prevents runtime errors
•	Avoids undefined/unsafe C behaviors
•	Improves code safety, readability, and maintainability
•	Widely used in automotive, aerospace, medical, and industrial systems
Where it is mainly used
•	Embedded systems
•	Safety-critical applications
•	Automotive ECUs (engine control units)
Key ideas of MISRA-C
•	Restricts dangerous C features
•	Enforces clear and consistent coding practices
•	Reduces bugs that compilers may not catch
